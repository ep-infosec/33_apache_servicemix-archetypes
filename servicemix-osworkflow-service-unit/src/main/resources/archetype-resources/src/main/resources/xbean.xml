    <!-- 
        The ServiceMix OSWorkflow component provides workflow functionality in the bus. You can specify one or
        more workflows and it's processing will start when a valid message is received.
        
        If you have no experience with the OSWorkflow itself, then it would be a good idea to have a look at 
        the website http://www.opensymphony.com/osworkflow/ and reading the documentation and tutorials there.

    <!-- 
        The OSWorkflow endpoint will receive messages from the NMR and will start then the processing
        of the workflow. You can send both InOnly and InOut messages to this endpoint.
        Sending an InOnly message will start the workflow in a separate thread, while sending an InOut
        will result in synchronous processing of the workflow.
